# dota2-discord-bot

Discord bot that provides Dota2 related utilities.



Use [**this**](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=189656913246420992&scope=bot&permissions=268561414) link to invite the bot to your server.

##Adding matches

You can add your games to the bot's DB following these simple steps:

1. `!add_steamid <32bit steamid>` - links Steam ID to your Discord ID.
2. `!parse_my_game_history` - Parses your matches into DB. Takes about 10-15 min per 1000 games. 

**NOTE: Dota2 API gives a maximum of 500 last games for each hero you play. So if you have more than 500 games as same hero bot may not be able to get full stats.**

**NOTE2: Make sure you have "Expose Public Match Data" setting enabled in the Dota 2.**

**NOTE3: After successfully adding your Steam id bot will automatically parse your Dota 2 matches into DB every hour**
